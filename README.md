# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using Python. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how external documents or knowledge sources can be retrieved and incorporated to augment a language model's responses.

## 🧠 What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines:
- **Retrieval**: Searching for relevant documents or passages from a corpus.
- **Generation**: Using a language model to generate a response based on the retrieved information.

This approach is commonly used in question-answering tasks, chatbot systems, and AI agents to improve accuracy and relevance.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
rag.py                 # Main script implementing RAG logic
README.md              # Project documentation (this file)
```

---

## 🚀 Features

- Custom query input
- Retrieves relevant context from a local knowledge base
- Generates responses using a language model (LLM)
- Modular and extensible code structure

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If there's no `requirements.txt`, install packages based on your script (e.g., `langchain`, `openai`, `chromadb`, etc.)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python rag.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter a query and return a generated answer based on retrieved context.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- LangChain / ChromaDB / OpenAI API *(based on usage in the script)*
- FAISS or similar vector store
- Sentence Transformers or OpenAI embeddings

---

## 📌 Use Cases

- Chatbots with knowledge-grounding
- AI assistants
- Custom search-based AI systems
- Domain-specific question answering
