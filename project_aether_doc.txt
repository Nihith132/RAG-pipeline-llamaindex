Project 'Aether' is a multimodal AI model developed by the fictional research group Lumin Labs, released in the second quarter of 2024. It features a 20-billion parameter transformer architecture and was trained on a proprietary dataset of 5 trillion tokens, which included synthetic code and peer-reviewed scientific papers. A key constraint of Project 'Aether' is that its use is strictly limited by an academic license; it cannot be used for any for-profit, commercial applications whatsoever. Furthermore, the public API for the model has a hard rate limit of 60 requests per minute per user.
